##> How is it working?
AngularCamp is a collaborative community conference for all people which are interested in in coming
together to share their recent work in a collaborative manner.

At the beginning of the conference participants propose ideas for talks, workshops, and demos that are then
curated and put into sessions. Besides that, we already received some proposals which will be a fix part of
AngularCamp. You can find them on the schedule page.

After the session design phase at the beginning, participants can choose which of the sessions to attend. In
addition to the ongoing sessions, socializing and open discussion are encouraged in the open areas in order
to promote cross-pollination of ideas. The overall idea is to have a creative space where people can share
their ideas and listen to others. AngularCamp provides just enough structure to unite everyone with openness
to allow for creativity to flow.

##> What to expect
AngularCamp is a collaborative community conference for all people which are interested in coming together to share their recent work in a collaborative manner. The goal of the this camp is to help strengthen the skills of the Angular community and offer insights to techniques, trends and feature development.
