## AngularCamp

A local event focused on everything related to AngularJS

##> What to expect
You may be wondering what’s going on in an AngularCamp. The first AngularCamp will happen in Barcelona and we hope the next ones will come easily to more locations. An AngularCamp is an informal meetup community-organized event that brings together kindred spirits from the Angular community in one place.

Everyone from newbies to experts are welcome to participate in order to share, learn and get to know each other.

Each AngularCamp will be different based on the organizers, mentors and attendees of each event but there will be some general guidelines that all AngularCamps will follow.

##> It’s all about going beyond AngularJS 
We love AngularJS and we want to connect with other communities  to meetup and play with code in person. AngularCamp meetups are dedicated to the AngularJS framework.
##> Focused on the attendees
An AngularCamp can’t get compared with annual worldwide AngularJS conferences: AngularCamp wants to keep motivation and passion inside community with more constant meetups driven from inside the community.

AngularCamps don’t need to be big, fancy or expensive events. AngularCamps are meant to be focused on the attendees and their expectations  in a cost effective way, based on the local investment available to support it. Typically venues should be cheap ( or free ) to allow attendees to join the event and make it more accessible to all in order to attend, meet people, share experiences and knowledge, and learn together.

Supporters and donations make all this possible, keeping ticket prices very low below 30€ for a 2-day event. It’s not strange that also collaborators will join for free because all it’s focused to create a sustainable community as well a safe environment where everyone can join the community.

##> Shared with community
AngularCamp DO NOT discriminate. Developers, designers, makers and other enthusiasts should all feel welcome at AngularCamp - no matter what the level of experience.

Sessions generally will have different formats: keynotes, lightning talks, live demos, Q&A, workshops, interviews and any new format that you can imagine.

AngularCamps are not meant to be just about having speakers, that’s main reason that we prefer to talk about “collaborators”. These collaborators can be anyone inside the local meetup community that wants to help and share knowledge.

There is no schedule or collaborator list in advance. Everybody can apply with a contribution. Everybody can vote for contributions. The contributions with the most upvotes will be picked.

##> Get connected, engage collaboration.
We want to use the internet to get off the internet. Getting to meet and learn from other people face-to-face is one of the main reasons people attend AngularCamps.

Thanks to AngularCamps’ volunteers, they  will try to help fellow attendees with their questions in addition to learning from each other. Attendees have a great opportunity to find new friends, collaborators and potential inspiration in the AngularCamp crowd. All these can lead to an exciting, sustainable and engaged community driven.

Every AngularCamp is a “big event” of a local AngularJS meetup group (indeed if it doesn’t exist is a great way to kick it off)
 
##> Think globally, act locally
The AngularCamp calendar is coordinated by AngularCamp.org but each individual meetup is organized by local AngularJS people. We will provide guidance but we not taking any decisions. AngularCamp are not meant to be an event with the same collaborators at every event, so we will try to tend to have both local and visiting collaborators. 
##> Non-profit
AngularCamps will use supporters money and donations to benefit the community not treated as profit to be pocketed by the organizers. 

AngularCamps organized as money-making opportunities are not approved to use the AngularCamp name.
##> Safe environment & Fun
AngularCamps are meant to be focused on: safe environment (CoC), learning, sharing and socialize with people but most important: have fun without lose the focus. There will be different activities, spaces and actions to make it happen (need to go beyond the code)
